# Profiles REST API

Built a fully functional REST API from scratch using Django and Django REST Framework, with features like user authentication, profile management, status updates, and status feed viewing. The project involved setting up a local development environment with Vagrant and VirtualBox, testing API calls with ModHeaders, and deploying the API to AWS. This hands-on experience provided a solid foundation in backend development, API design, and real-world deployment, enhancing both technical skills and the ability to integrate backend services with frontend applications.
